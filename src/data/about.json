I'm Anirudh - a Software Engineer,\ngrad student at the University of Florida,\nand someone who believes the best code\nis written after a good volleyball game\nand a home-cooked meal.\n\n---\n\nBy day, I build scalable full-stack apps\nat Accoladi.com, architecting systems\nthat handle 100K+ daily requests. I love\nthe puzzle of turning messy problems into\nclean, performant solutions.\n\nBy night? You'll find me lost in a fantasy\nnovel (currently on TBATE), experimenting\nwith recipes in the kitchen, or gaming\nwith friends.\n\n---\n\nWhat gets me excited:\n  > Real-time systems\n  > AI/ML applications\n  > Infrastructure that just works\n\nFinishing M.Sc. in CS (May 2025).\nBuilding something cool? Let's chat!"
