  "title": "About Me",
  "content": "Hey there! 👋 I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer and creative problem solver with 5+ years of experience building scalable web applications.\n\nWhat drives me? I love the intersection of elegant code and beautiful design. Whether it's architecting a microservices backend or crafting pixel-perfect UIs, I approach every challenge with enthusiasm and attention to detail.\n\nMy superpower is turning complex requirements into simple, intuitive solutions. I've led teams, mentored junior developers, and shipped products used by thousands of users. But what really excites me is continuous learning - there's always a new technology to explore or a better way to solve a problem.\n\nWhen I'm not coding, you'll find me contributing to open source, writing technical blogs, or experimenting with AI and machine learning. I believe in building things that matter and making the web a better place, one line of code at a time."
