  "title": "About Me",
  "content": "Hey! I'm Anirudh — a Software Engineer, grad student at the University of Florida, and someone who believes the best code is written after a good volleyball game and a home-cooked meal.\n\nBy day, I build scalable full-stack applications at ScholarshipAuditions.com, architecting systems that handle 100K+ daily requests for users. I love the puzzle of turning messy legacy code into clean, performant systems — there's something deeply satisfying about a 40% performance boost.\n\nBy night? You'll find me lost in a fantasy novel (currently on a TBATE), experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, or gaming with friends. I find that stepping away from the screen often leads to my best problem-solving breakthroughs.\n\nWhat gets me excited: real-time systems, AI/ML applications, and infrastructure that just works. I've built everything from NLP content moderation tools to AWS pipelines processing thousands of videos.\n\nI'm finishing my M.Sc. in Computer Science (May 2025) and always looking for interesting problems to solve. If you're building something cool, let's chat!"
